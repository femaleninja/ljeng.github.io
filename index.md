Hi, I'm Lareine. I teach college-level computer science and a few other STEM subjects at C2 Education. As an educator, I'm interested in closing the gender disparity in computing by encouraging females to learn programming and helping them break barriers to career advancement. Before C2, I studied engineering at Cooper Union on a full merit scholarship and then went on to complete a full batch at the Recurse Center.

I published [my first paper](/files/neumann2009.pdf) in the *Journal of Neuroscience Methods* at age 17. The first of many accomplishments over my career in academia, this paper has been cited over 60 times to date. My research since then has spanned topics ranging from computational chemistry to the algorithms that control self-driving vehicles. I've also written code for personal use such as investing and optimizing the travel rewards earned from credit card churning.

Since 2009, I've been the record holder at the Coho Memorial, a college varsity sailing regatta held annually among teams from all over the Mid-Atlantic region.
