Hi, I'm Lareine. I teach college-level computer science and a few other STEM subjects at C2 Education. As an educator, I'm interested in closing the gender disparity in computing by encouraging females to learn programming and helping them break barriers to career advancement. In professional and academic environments, I've done statistical modeling in various applications including computer-assisted gait analysis in stroke victims, computational chemistry, and the algorithms that control self-driving vehicles. I've also written code for personal use such as investing and optimizing the travel rewards earned from credit card churning. I studied engineering at Cooper Union on a full merit scholarship and then went on to complete a full batch at the Recurse Center. Before Cooper, I sailed competitively and finished in first place at the Coho Memorial, an intercollegiate sailing regatta with participants from all over the Mid-Atlantic region. I published [my first paper](/files/neumann2009.pdf) in the *Journal of Neuroscience Methods* at age 17, which has been cited over 60 times.
