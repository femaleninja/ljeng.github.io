Hi, I'm Lareine. I teach college-level computer science and a few other STEM subjects at C2 Education. As an educator, I'm interested in closing the gender disparity in computing by encouraging females to learn computer science and helping them break barriers to career advancement. In professional and academic environments, I've done statistical modeling in various applications including computer-assisted gait analysis in stroke victims, computational chemistry, and the algorithms that control self-driving vehicles. I've also written code for personal use such as investing and optimizing credit card churning and the travel rewards earned from it. I studied engineering at Cooper Union on a full merit-based scholarship and then went on to complete a full batch at the Recurse Center. Before Cooper, I attended Webb Institute for naval architecture and marine engineering and competed on the co-ed varsity sailing team there.
