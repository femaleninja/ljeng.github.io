### [Ethical Engineering](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2oj472d4o411kg8/AABbTodUT3u6ayjGrXSonKTNa)
I talked about the process of constructing ethical frameworks for autonomous machines at the Recurse Center.

### [Design and Construction of a Bridge](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4rur7rilr98wmun/AADQN-pmft81kDrKV-xNcGisa)
Co-authors: Daniel Gologorskiy, Jorge Olaso

We constructed a bridge that was six feet in length and capable of supporting 400 pounds of force. We then ran a compression test on the bridge.

### [Watersports Dock Rehabilitation](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/b7lbzvcvfqa8hk3/AACi3atw9bN_q9WjSNoEgsR8a)
Co-authors: Daniel Molinaro, [Jake Hughes](http://www.hughesjake.com/), Amanda Yuan, [Isha Patel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patelisha23/)

Alpha Group drafted a plan to rehabilitate a watersports dock in Boca Chica, Dominican Republic by replacing the concrete and bench, constructing a dock, installing stairs and a ramp, and using a concrete sealer.

### [Flying Dutchman](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o17fburs0mrm2ii/AADdEDQXL72c4lSLCejDMV5Da)

I drafted a three-view hand drawing and AutoCAD drawing of the Flying Dutchman, a former Olympic-class sailboat, from a table of molded offsets.

### [Open-Source Laser Cutter](http://dap.cooper.edu/doku.php?id=start:projects:cnclasercutter)
Co-contributors: Calvin Ball, et al.
Advisor: [Dr. Eric Lima](https://cooper.edu/engineering/people/eric-g-lima)

We combined a laser cutter and a CNC milling machine to achieve the functional goal of cutting thin woods and plastics.

### [The Effect of Solvent and Solute Polarity on Thermodynamic Stabilization of Solute Molecules by Solvent Molecules](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vz9rv1lgmqo9uqx/spartan.docx)
I simulated molecules in Spartan, a molecular modeling and computational chemistry application. I derived a linear function to predict the solvation energy as the function of the dipole moment, polar surface area, and volume of a solute, and the dielectric constant of the solvent using the least-squares regression method.
